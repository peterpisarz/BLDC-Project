# BLDC-Project
Project Files for my first Brushless DC Motor

This is a project I created originally as a work sample for companies to view when applying for design positions. Much of what I have worked on in the past is IP or is a classified military application and can't be shared. I love design and this was a way I could show off my skillset.

The project is a radial flux Brushless DC Motor. I selected hardware off of McMaster and then began to design a stator body which would be 3D printed. Traditional BLDC motors are made from iron laminate sheets which guide magnetic fields and reduce eddy currents. This material has a much lower magnetic permeability but still functions well achieving speeds of up to 2000rpms. Here is a video of it in action:

I liked this project and thought it would be repeatable for others, so I made the design and build of this into an online course. You can watch a preview lesson of the course in the link below. This takes you through my logic of selecting the bearings, drive shaft and other components, how I assemble them, run a tolerance stack analysis and plan my build.

If you enjoyed this project please consider following my Twitter. I am always designing new motors and intend to build a quadcopter in the near future.
